Chapter 3: HiLow
Introduction

During this chapter we will be creating a High Low number guessing game. This game will prompt the user to guess a number between 1 and 100, if they guess too low or too high the program will tell them, if they get it right the program will tell them how many guesses it took.

To summarize:
	Create an answer between 1-100
	Prompt the user to guess 1-100
	Take in their input
	If they got it correct tell them how many guesses it took
	Tell them if it's too high/low
	Allow them to keep guessing until it's correct
	After that ask if they'd like to keep playing

I suggest giving this project a stab on your own, if you get stuck you can follow one of the guides I've made.
