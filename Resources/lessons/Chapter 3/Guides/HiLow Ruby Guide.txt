Chapter 3: HiLow
Ruby Guide

Create an answer between 1-100 and keep track of their guesses
	answer = rand(1..100)
	numGuesses = 1

Prompt the user to guess 1-100
	puts "Hello and welcome to the High-low number guessing game."
	print "Guess a number between 1 and 100:"
	
Take in user input
	Since gets.chomp returns a String we will have to convert it into a whole number "var.to_i" (this is called casting) 
		guess = gets.chomp.to_i

If they got it correct tell them how many guesses it took
	if (guess == answer)
		print "Congrats, you got it in ", numGuesses, " guesses.\n"
	end

Tell them if it's too high/low
	Continuing the if statement above
		if (guess == answer)
			...
		elsif (guess < answer)
			puts "Too low"
			numGuesses += 1
		elsif (guess > answer)
			puts "Too high"
			numGuesses += 1
		end

Allow them to keep guessing until it's correct
	This is where we need to wrap our code in a while loop, first make a boolean:
		win = false
		while win == false do
			print "Guess a number between 1 and 100:"
			...
		end
	We'll also have to change the win variable in order for the loop to end:
		if (guess == answer)
			win = true
		...

After that ask if they'd like to keep playing
	Asking for input:
		puts "Would you like to play again?(y/n):"
		playAgain = gets.chomp
		if (playAgain == "n")
			playing = false
			puts "Goodbye"
		end
	Next creating a play loop to keep the game running:
		playing = true
		puts "Hello and welcome to the High-low number guessing game."
		while (playing) do
		...
		end

And that should do it, if you'd like to see the complete code look for HiLow.rb in the examples folder.
