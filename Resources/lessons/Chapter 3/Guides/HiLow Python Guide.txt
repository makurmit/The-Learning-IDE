Chapter 3: HiLow
Python Guide

Prerequisites
	We'll first need to import the random class:
		import random

Create an answer between 1-100
	First we need to create the answer variable:
		answer = random.randint(1, 100)
		numGuesses = 1
	We will also need to keep track of their guesses so here's a good spot to put that
		
Prompt the user to guess 1-100
	This is a simple print, I like to welcome them to the game first:
		print("Hello and welcome to the High-low number guessing game.")
		print("Guess a number between 1 and 100:")

Take in their input
	All we need to do is use input():
		guess = input()
	But we can alter the top line to make this more efficient:
		guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100:"))
	Another thing about this line is the int() part, this is called casting and takes whatever is in the parentheses and tries to make it into a whole number, if it's not a whole number it will default to 0.

If they got it correct tell them how many guesses it took
	Simple if statement:
		if (guess == answer):
			print("Congrats, you got it in", numGuesses, "guesses.")

Tell them if it's too high/low
	In the same if statement as above continue it into an elif:
		elif (guess < answer):
			print("Too Low")
			#this increments and assigns the variable similar to var++ in Java
			numGuesses += 1
		elif (guess > answer):
			print("Too High")
			numGuesses += 1

Allow them to keep guessing until it's correct
	This is where we'll have to wrap our code in a while loop, but the tricky part is where to start and end it. A good place is right after the creation of the answer and number of guesses:
		numGuesses = 1
		win = False
		while (win == False):
			guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100:"))
			...
	Next we'll need to make sure the loop ends, otherwise they'll be stuck playing:
		if (guess == answer):
			print("Congrats, you got it in", numGuesses, "guesses.")
			win = True

After that ask if they'd like to keep playing
	This is another loop that will be wrapped around our code, 
	but first we need to ask them if they want to keep playing:
		playAgain = input("Would you like to play again?(y/n):")
		if (playAgain == "n"):
			playing = False
			print("Goodbye!")
	Now we need to put in the while loop, first create the boolean "playing"
		playing = True
		while (playing):
			answer = random.randint(1, 100)
			...

And that should do it, if you'd like to see the complete code look for HiLow.py in the examples folder.
