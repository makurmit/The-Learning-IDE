Chapter 2: The Basics
Lesson 5: Random


Random() is a method that determines a random number. A method is a section of code that can be called from other code. Methods can return a value, in this case Random() will return a number. Sometimes you need to specify some variables before using a method, these are called parameters or arguments and are put inside the parentheses when calling that method. Random() is in almost every programming language.

In Java Random() looks like this:
	//this needs to be put at the top of the file, it tells Java we will need Random() later
	import java.util.Random;

	//this creates a new instance of Random() that we can use, you don't have to name it 'rand'
	Random rand = new Random();
	int num = rand.nextInt(10);
The 10 inside the parentheses dictate that we want a number between 0 and 9 (exclusive).
But what if you want it to be 5 and 10? Same thing, just add the minimum value after the generation:
	int num = rand.nextInt(6) + 5;
It creates an int between 0 and 5 and then adds 5, making the range 5 to 10.

If you want a double simply use this:
	Random rand = new Random();
	double digit = rand.nextDouble();
This will give us a decimal between 0 and 1.


In C# Random() looks like this:
	//same as Java but you don't have to import it
	Random rand = new Random();
	int num = rand.Next(5, 10);
This Random() takes 2 parameters, a min value and a max value. So num will be a random int between 5 and 10.


JavaScript:
	var num = Math.round(Math.random() * 9) + 1;
Math.random creates a number between 0 and 1, multiply that by 9 and round it will create a random number between 0 and 9, adding one changes the range to 1-10.


In Python:
	import random
	num = random.randint(5,10)
In this case we don't need to make a new instance of random, but we do need to give it two arguments: a min value and a max value. Also this is inclusive, so in this example num would be a random number between 5 and 10.


In Ruby:
	num = rand(5..10)
That's it, this will return a random number between 5 and 10 (inclusive). If you only specify a max value it will be exclusive.
