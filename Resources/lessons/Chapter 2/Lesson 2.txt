Chapter 2: The Basics
Lesson 2: Comments

Comments are helpful for large projects and a necessity when working in groups. They are lines of code that will not be run. Comments are mainly used for explaining what a section of code does. Java, JavaScript, and C# use the same types of comments "//" for a single line:
	//we need a name, age, and can vote boolean
	String name = "Jim";
	int age = 12;
	boolean canVote = false;
It can also be used in multiple lines with "/*", "*", and "*/" as the end tag:
	/*
	* this is a multi-line comment
	*/

	
Python and Ruby syntax for a single line comment is "#":
	#we need a name, age and can vote boolean
	name = "Jim"
	age = 12
	canVote = False
Python syntax for multi-line comments are triple quotes:
	"""
	a multi-line comment in Python
	"""
	

Lastly Ruby's syntax for multi-line comments are "=begin" and "=end" at the beginning of lines (no spaces)
	=begin
	Ruby multi-line comment
	=end
