Chapter 4: Methods and Classes
HiLow v2 Ruby Guide:

One thing we need to keep in mind is where we put our code in Ruby. If we put the methods at the bottom of file the program won't compile them. Soo the first step we should take is create a playLoop():
	def playLoop()
		playing = true
		...	
		return playing
	end
Inside the method is everything except the prompt and first while loop. Now let's call it in that while loop:
	puts "Hello and welcome to the High-low number guessing game."
	while (playing) do
		playing = playLoop()
	end
This will make sure the loop continues until the user quits.

Next we'll refactor the guessing loop:
	def guessLoop(answer)
		win = false
		...		
		return win
	end
First we need to know the answer, since we don't want to recreate it every loop. Next we check to see if they got the answer right, if so win = true, else if too high/low puts "too high/low". Lastly we return the boolean win.
Now let's call guessLoop() inside the while loop in playLoop():
	while win == false do
		win = guessLoop(answer)
		if (win)
			print "Congrats, you got it in ", numGuesses, " guesses.\n"
		else
			numGuesses += 1
		end
	end
This will allow them to keep guessing while also incrementing the number of guesses.


Once you have finished run it and see if it still works. Just like the previous project my program will be in the "Examples" folder.
