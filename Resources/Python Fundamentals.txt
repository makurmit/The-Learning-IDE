Python Fundamentals

Introduction: 
	Python is an open source scripting language. It is very approachable and dynamically typed. Open source languages are open to the public and anyone can make changes to the language. Scripting languages tend to deal with smaller programs that do one or a few tasks. Scripting languages are not compiled, they are interpreted at run time. Python is designed to be simple and readable, because of this Python is deemed a great beginning language. Dynamically typed languages don't need type declaration for variables.

Advantages: 
	Like said above, Python is great for beginners because of the readability. Dynamically typed languages are very fun to code in, it's surprising how much time it saves for creating variables. Since it's an interpreted language it takes less time to start the program and is great for small projects. This was intended as Python focuses more on what to do not how to do it.

Disadvantages: 
	A major complaint from experienced programmers is that Python is whitespace delimited, meaning tabs and spaces matter. If there is a misplaced tab or an extra space everything will break. Dynamically typed is convenient but may lead to some issues as variables could be misinterpreted while coding and used incorrectly. Overall Python runs slower than a compiled language, while it starts faster it will run slower than a language like Java or C#. However if used in small programs this won't be much of a problem.
