Chapter 1: Hello World Python

print("Hello World!")

Python is fairly straight forward and requires little overhead. Unlike Java and C# it doesn't need semicolons ";" to end lines.


"print()" takes whatever is in the parentheses and prints it out to the console.


Once you have completed the program press the "run" button.
