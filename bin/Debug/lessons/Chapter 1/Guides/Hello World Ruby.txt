Chapter 1: Hello World Ruby

puts "Hello World!"


Ruby is fairly simple, there aren't that many things you need to worry about. Unlike Java and Python Ruby isn't case sensitive, tab-delimited, and it doesn't need semicolons ";" at the end of lines.


"Puts" takes whatever is in the quotes and prints it out to the console.


Once you have completed the program press the "run" button.
