Chapter 1: Hello World JavaScript

<html>
	<body>
		<p>Hello World!</p>
	</body>
</html>

JavaScript is a scripting language that requires HTML (CSS helps but isn't necessary). So all this code is HTML, not necessarily scripting but it's the best way to display "Hello World!". That being said write this in the "index.html" page.

The angle brackets "<>" "</>" dictate tags or sections of the HTML that create different areas of the webpage. For our projects we'll only be using the "html", "body", and "p" tags. The "html" tag specifies everything in between them is to be interpreted as HTML code. The "body" tag states that this content will be in the middle of the page. The "p" tag is paragraph text, anything between those tags will be displayed as basic text.

Once you have written this open the "index.html" page in a browser.
