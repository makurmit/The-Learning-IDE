Chapter 1: Hello World Java

public class HelloWorld
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}

This may look intimidating at first but it becomes more simple later on. The file name also matters in this case, you must name it "HelloWorld".


The first line is the class declaration, the only thing to note about this is that it's public. Next we have our main method. Every Java file requires a main method: this is where the program starts. Lastly we have System.out.println(); this line takes whatever is in the parentheses and prints it out to the console.


Once you have completed the program press the "run" button.
