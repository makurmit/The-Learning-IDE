Chapter 2: The Basics

This chapter will cover beginning concepts: primitive types, conditional statements, loops, random number generation, user input.

Primitive types is a fancy way of saying variables, variables store data, can be read, manipulated, and deleted throughout a program. 
Comments document code, they are not run as code and are used by developers to explain sections of their code.
Conditional statements are ways to branch code, "if", "else if", and "else" statements dictate whether or not code will be run.
Loops run certain sections of code as many times as you want.
Random number generating is a utility that determines a random number.
User input is anything we need to get from the user, common examples are: username, password, date of birth.


With all of these components we should be able to make a high-low number guessing game. This is a basic program that creates a random number, has the user guess what it is, and gives feedback on whether their guess was too high or too low.


There won't be any directed programs in these lessons but I recommend toying around with the information given, don't be afraid to throw something together just to see what happens.
