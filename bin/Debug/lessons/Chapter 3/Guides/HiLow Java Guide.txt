Chapter 3: HiLow
Java Guide

Prerequisites
	First we need to populate the file with the necessary class, main method, and utilities:
	import java.util.Random;
	import java.util.Scanner;
	public class HiLow {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		}
	}
	
Create an answer between 1-100 and keep track of guesses
	Random rand = new Random();
	Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
	int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;
	int numGuesses = 1;

Prompt the user to guess 1-100
	System.out.println("Hello and welcome to the High-low number guessing game.");
	System.out.print("Guess a number between 1 and 100:");
	
Take in their input
	int guess = scan.nextInt();

If they got it correct tell them how many guesses it took
	if (guess == answer) {
		System.out.println("Congrats, you got in " + numGuesses + " guesses.");
	}

Tell them if it's too high/low
	Continuing from the if statement above:
		else if (guess < answer) {
			System.out.println("Too low");
			numGuesses++;
		}
		else if (guess > answer) {
			System.out.println("Too high");
			numGuesses++;
		}

Allow them to keep guessing until it's correct
	This is where we wrap the code in a do/while loop
		int numGuesses = 1;
		boolean win = false;
		do {
		...
		} while(!win);
	Don't forget to change the win variable:
		if (guess == answer) {
			win = true;
			System.out.println("Congrats, you got in " + numGuesses + " guesses.");
		}

After that ask if they'd like to keep playing
	After the do/while:
		System.out.println("Would you like to play again?(y/n)");
		String playAgain = scan.next();
		if (playAgain.equals("n")) {
			scan.close();
			playing = false;
			System.out.println("Goodbye");
		}
	Wrap it in a while (or do/while):
		System.out.println("Hello and welcome to the High-low number guessing game.");
		boolean playing = true;
		while (playing) {
		...
		}


And that should do it, if you'd like to see the complete code look for HiLow.java in the examples folder.
