Chapter 3: HiLow
JavaScript Guide

First the HTML:
	<html>
		<body>
			
		</body>
	</html>
This creates the basic webpage with the body. 

Next we add some text to prompt the user:
	<p>I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.</p>

Now let's create the form to get input:
	<form>
		<input type="text" name="inputBox" value="">
		<input type="button" value="Submit" onClick="SendData(this.form)">
	</form>
The textbox will allow for a space to put input and the button will send the input into the JavaScript file. 

Now we have to add a section to prompt the user whether their guess was too high or too low.
	<p id=""/>
This will be used later in the JavaScript file.

Lastly we need to specify our JavaScript file:
	<script src="GuessingGame.js">
		
	</script>
Inside these tags we can dictate when the file will be ran:
	<script src="GuessingGame.js">
		do {
			SendData(this.form);
		}while (numGuessed != answer);
	</script>
This do/while will send the form data to the JavaScript file until they get the answer right.

Okay, now the front end is done, next we work on the JavaScript file.

First create the random answer:
	var answer = Math.round(Math.random() * 99) + 1;

Next create the variables to keep track of the number of guesses and their guess:
	var guesses = 1;
	var guess = 0;

Now create the function SendData() that takes in the form data:
	function SendData(form){
	
	}

Inside of that method we need to find their guess:
	guess = form.inputBox.value;
this takes the value inside of the form's inputBox and assigns its value to "guess".

Okay, now check to see if they got it right, if they did change the prompt:
	if (guess == answer){
		document.getElementById('prompt').innerHTML = "CORRECT! It took only " + guesses + " guesses.";
	}
ElementById() will find the HTML element and then we can change it with the "innerHTML" property.
	
Let's add the other cases, if it is out of range, improper input, too high, or too low, also increment the number of guesses:
	else if (guess < 0 || guess > 101){
		document.getElementById('prompt').innerHTML = "Out of range, guess between 1 and 100.";
		guesses++;
	}
	
	else if(guess > answer){
		document.getElementById('prompt').innerHTML = "Too high, try again.";
		guesses++;
	}
	
	else if(guess < answer){
		document.getElementById('prompt').innerHTML = "Too low, try again.";
		guesses++;
	}
	
	else if (guess != answer){
		document.getElementById('prompt').innerHTML = "Try again, numbers  between 1 and 100.";
		guesses++;
	}
Since JavaScript is weakly typed it isn't likely to break if you compare strings to numbers, that's what "guess != answer" does, it makes sure that it isn't a number.


That should be about it, open the "index.html" file in a browser and try it out. If you'd like to see my code check in the JavaScript folder under the examples folder.
